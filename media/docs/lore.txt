PlanetCraft lore

Brief history of planet Gamma

Millions of years ago, a great civilization prospered on Gamma. It discovered spaceflight, explored the solar system, and discovered its sun was dying. Out of necessity, interstellar travel was developed, and the civilization left Gamma.

The sun eventually faded away, and for millenia, Gamma was blanketed in darkness. By happenstance, a wayward asteroid composed mostly of <glowing_element> became caught in orbit of Gamma, and light returned to the planet.

Life has also returned to Gamma over time, and small pockets of animal life exist.
